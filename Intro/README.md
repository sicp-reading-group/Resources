##Intro
The idea with the "book club" is to have a group of people who are all equally interested in reading the SICP. It's a difficult book to read especially with everything that everyone has going on. This will make the learning part more fun and engaging as well as act as a accountability platform and motivation source

## General flow
The general flow will be:
* Read a chapter or a section
* Come and discuss about your insights/confusions at the meetups OR in the group
* Work through the exercises together (This is very important because you can't learn to code unless you write code)
* Speak to someone who knows more than you (Learning is always more fun if done with a group of people)
